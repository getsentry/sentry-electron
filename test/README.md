# Tests ðŸ§ª

## Unit Tests

Currently there are only unit tests [covering path normalization](./unit/normalize.test.ts).

Running the unit tests:

```shell
yarn test
```

## End-to-end Tests

There is an extensive matrix of end-to-end tests that run on CI and test:

- All supported versions of Electron (2.0+)
- All major platforms (Windows, macOS and Linux)
- All features and integrations
- Event and session submission to mock Sentry server
- Successful bundling and subsequent event submission

Running the end-to-end tests:

```shell
yarn e2e
```

If the `ELECTRON_VERSION` environment variable is set, only that version of Electron will be tested, otherwise all
versions will be tested.

### Test Recipes

Each individual e2e test consists of a test recipe which is a self contained application in its own right. There are
simple [functional test recipes](./e2e/test-apps/) and [example app recipes](../examples/).

Recipes are run sequentially and the events submitted to the mock server are compared to the expected events using
`chai-subset`.

Each recipe should contain:

- `recipe.yml` (details below)
- `package.json` with a unique `name`
- Events expected to be sent to the server (`event*.json`/`session*.json`)

#### `recipe.yml`

The `recipe.yml` contains a number of optional keys with only `description` required.

Run a single test by renaming to `recipe.only.yml`.

| Key             | Type      | Description                                             |
| --------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `description`   | `string`  | Friendly name displayed in test output                  |
| `category`      | `string`  | Used for grouping test output                           |
| `command`       | `string`  | Initialization/build command to run in app root         |
| `condition`     | `string`  | JavaScript expression for conditionally skipping a test |
| `timeout`       | `number`  | Test timeout in seconds                                 |
| `runTwice`      | `boolean` | If the application should be run twice                  |
| `expectedError` | `string`  | Expected error string in log output                     |

#### `condition`

A JavaScript expression evaluated to `boolean` and used to determine whether the test should be run for the current
platform and version of Electron. A number of variables are available to simplify usage:

```ts
namespace Global {
  const platform: 'win32' | 'darwin' | 'linux';
  const version: { major: number; minor: number; patch: number };
  const usesCrashpad: boolean;
  const supportsContextIsolation: boolean;
}
```

If a test should only run for Electron >= v5 where Crashpad is used, the `condition` would be:

```ts
version.major >= 5 && usesCrashpad;
```

#### `runTwice`

Some tests require that the application is run a second time so that crashes or sessions can be sent from the first run.

In the app, you can differentiate between the first and second run via the `APP_FIRST_RUN` environment variable. Recipe
apps are expected to close themselves after the first run.

#### `expectedError`

Some test are expected to throw errors or log output to the console. If `expectedError` is defined, the test will fail
if the string cannot be found in the application log output.

### Recipe Steps

1. If `condition` is defined, it's evaluated and the recipe is skipped if it returns `false`
2. All files apart from `recipe.yaml`/`event*.json`/`session*.json` are copied to a temporary directory
3. Occurrences of `__DSN__` found in any file are replaced with the the mock server localhost DSN
4. If `@sentry/electron` is found in the dependencies in `package.json`, the version is replaced with a path to the npm
   packed SDK in the project root `file:../../../sentry-electron-{version}.tgz`
5. If `command` is defined, it's run via `spawnSync(command, { shell: true})` in the root of the recipe and a non-zero
   exit code results in test failure
6. Application is started with a specific Electron version
7. If `runTwice == true`, the app will be started again when it closes
8. Wait for the expected number of events to be sent to the mock server
9. Compare received events and ensure they match events found in `event*.json`/`session*.json` files
   - Server events are normalized by replacing timestamps, versions and IDs so they can be compared
   - `event*.json`/`session*.json` may contain a `condition` key so event matching can vary by platform or Electron
     version
10. If `expectedError` is defined, ensure string is found in log output
